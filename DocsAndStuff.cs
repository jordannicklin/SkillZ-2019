    - What is this file?! -
    The SkillZ webkit doesn't allow uploading .txt files, so I made this a .cs file so that we can use it at the finals!
    I kept the `class` code here because the webkit doesn't like empty .cs files either (I dont know why)

    - How to add a new feature? -

    * Does it use mana / is it something we can 'produce/summon/make'? *
    If yes, add it to Virtual*.cs and implement it properly in VirtualGame.cs

    * Does it add new 'get' functions in Constants.Game? *
    If yes, add it to `GameCaching.cs` and call those functions from there.

    * Is it a new creature? *
    If yes, add basic niave MoveTo and Attack heuristics

    * Is it something we can build? *
    If yes, create heuristics for building it

    We should continue writing stuff in this file that we will want to have with us in the compeition.
